                Picture this: It's 1700, and you just bought bread from your local baker. He pulls out a quill pen, dips it in ink, and carefully writes on a small piece of paper: "One loaf of bread—3 pence." He hands it to you with flour-dusted fingers.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[#0a3d62] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                That's how receipts started. And for the next 300 years, they barely changed.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[#0a3d62] leading-relaxed mb-6">

                The Very Beginning: Proof of Purchase Through the Ages
              </h2>
              <p className="text-[#0a3d62] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Receipts are older than you might think. Ancient civilizations used clay tablets, stone carvings, and papyrus to record trades. The earliest known written receipts were cuneiform tablets from 2029-1982 BCE, documenting transactions like rent payments and goods lists. Wealthy Egyptians used papyrus for receipts, while common people used broken pottery. Everyone needed proof they paid for something.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[#0a3d62] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Why? Same reason we do today. To prove ownership. To return faulty goods. To keep track of spending.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[#0a3d62] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Some things never change.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-[#0a3d62] mb-4 font-gloock">
                The Handwritten Era: 1600s-1800s
              </h2>
              <p className="text-[#0a3d62] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                For centuries, receipts meant one thing: handwriting.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[#0a3d62] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Every merchant kept a quill pen and ink nearby. They'd write each receipt by hand—what you bought, how much you paid, the date, their signature.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[#0a3d62] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                It was slow. Really slow. Imagine waiting for your barista to handwrite your coffee receipt every morning.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[#0a3d62] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The problem? Only one copy existed. Lose it, and you were out of luck.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[#0a3d62] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Then came carbon paper in the 1800s. Game changer. Merchants could make copies—one for the customer, one for their records. Suddenly, both parties had proof.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-[#0a3d62] mb-4 font-gloock">
                The Machine Age: 1879-1960s
              </h2>
              <p className="text-[#0a3d62] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                In 1879, James Ritty invented the cash register. But early versions didn't print receipts—merchants still wrote by hand.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[#0a3d62] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                That changed in 1883 with the first receipt-printing cash register. Now merchants could ring up sales quickly and print basic receipts automatically. Checkout went from a few minutes to about a minute.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[#0a3d62] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The 1900s brought bigger mechanical receipt machines that could print multiple copies and add totals automatically. The printing press revolutionized receipts in the mid-19th century, allowing pre-printed receipt templates to become standard for purchases and bank transactions. They were huge, expensive, and broke down constantly—but they worked.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[#0a3d62] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Then came the breakthrough: thermal paper in the 1960s. This special paper changed color when heated—no ink needed. Thermal printers were smaller, more reliable, and cheaper. By the 1970s, most businesses switched to thermal receipt printers.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[#0a3d62] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                That white paper that turns black in a hot car? That's thermal paper. It's what most stores still use today.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-[#0a3d62] mb-4 font-gloock">
                The Digital Age: 1980s-2010s
              </h2>
              <p className="text-[#0a3d62] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The 1980s brought computers to retail. Point-of-sale (POS) systems could now include detailed item descriptions, exact timestamps, and return policies. But receipts were still printed on paper.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[#0a3d62] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The internet changed online shopping in the 2000s. Email receipts became standard for websites like Amazon and eBay. Some physical stores started asking, "Would you like your receipt emailed?"
              </p>
              <p className="text-[#0a3d62] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                But email receipts were clunky—you had to give your email address, they ended up in spam folders, your inbox got cluttered, and merchants used your email for marketing spam. Most people still chose paper.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[#0a3d62] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Then smartphones arrived. Apple Pay launched in 2014, followed by Google Pay. Suddenly we could pay with our phones in seconds.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[#0a3d62] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                This created a weird situation: Digital payment → Paper receipt → Manual data entry into digital expense tracking.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[#0a3d62] leading-relaxed mb-6">
                It made no sense.
              </p>
